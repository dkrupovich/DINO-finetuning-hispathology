# DINO-finetuning-hispathology

This project is part of the Transformers course held by the University of Tartu. The project aims to finetune the DINO model using pre-trained weights from [Self-Supervised Vision Transformers Learn Visual Concepts in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00585).

The original DINO model that was used can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino). This model was modified to work with our data and weights.

The weights used for finetuning can be found [here](https://github.com/Richarizardd/Self-Supervised-ViT-Path).

This code was used for training a model and improving its performance. For more details about the project and the obtained results, take a look at ```Poster.pdf```
